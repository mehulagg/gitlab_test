# Terms list

Use this terms list when you're not sure how to use a word in GitLab docs, the UI, and in marketing materials.

The list follows rules in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html#capitalization)
and makes exceptions as needed. If a term is not listed here, use the Style Guide and consider raising an MR to add it.
