# Instance-level analytics

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/41416) in GitLab 11.2.

Administrators have access to instance-wide analytics, as shown in **Admin Area > Analytics**.

There are two kinds of statistics:

- [DevOps Report](dev_ops_report.md): Provides an overview of your entire instance's feature usage.
- [User Cohorts](user_cohorts.md): Display the monthly cohorts of new users and their activities over time.
