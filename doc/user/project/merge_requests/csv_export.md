# Export Merge Requests to CSV

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3619) in GitLab Core 13.5.

Merge requests can be exported as CSV from GitLab and are sent to your default notification email as an attachment.

## Overview

Export Merge Requests CSV enables you and your team to export all the data collected from merge requests into a comma-separated values (CSV) file, which stores tabular data in plain text. 

Exported files are generated asynchronously and delivered as an email attachment upon generation.

## Limitations

- Export merge requests to CSV is not available at the Group’s merge request list.
- As the merge requests will be sent as an email attachment, there is a limit on how much data can be exported. Currently this limit is 15MB to ensure successful delivery across a range of email providers. If this limit is reached we suggest narrowing the search before export, perhaps by exporting open and closed merge requests separately.
